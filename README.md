## Roles

There are a few predefined roles, they can be selected in _install-host.yml_.

The makefile offers to install all prerequisites on a host - only use this functionality in a trusted network! It will accept any ssh key without asking for further confirmation!

Type

```
make epel
```

to install the "epel" role.
